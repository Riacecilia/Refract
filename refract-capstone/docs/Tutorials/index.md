Welcome to the tutorials for Refract.

In this section, you can follow a step by step guide on how to implement Refract in a real life scenario.

This section contains 2 real life scenarios:

- [Setting a global theme for your application](../Tutorials/global-theme.md)

Both these examples will implement the 3 core concepts and Refract APIs.

Before you start


Install Refract so you can follow along with the real life examples, or copy the code snippets provided to your own project.
